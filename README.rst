ROS tools and utilities metapackage for Velodyne 3D LIDARs.

This package is *deprecated*.  Catkin stacks should never use it, but
rosbuild stacks depending on ``velodyne_utils`` will still work in
Hydro.

In Indigo, all references must use `velodyne_height_map`_ directly.

_`velodyne_height_map`: http://ros.org/wiki/velodyne_height_map
